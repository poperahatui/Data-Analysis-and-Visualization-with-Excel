In this portfolio, I tried data processing, exploration and manipulation, and made the following visualizations:
- Data Collection: Utilized programming techniques to systematically gather data from various sources.
- Exploration and Manipulation: Using Excel applications to explore, assess and manipulate the data collected. This involved tasks such as cleaning data, handling missing values, and transforming data sets to facilitate analysis.
- Creating Engaging Visualizations: Utilize Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts to create visually appealing Dashboards that effectively summarize and present key insights from processed data.

![The following is documentation of the results of the analysis and visualization in the form of a dashboard entitled "COFFE SALES DASHBOARD"](https://github.com/poperahatui/Data-Analysis-and-Visualization-with-Excel/blob/main/Coffe%20Sales%20Dashboard.png?raw=true)

**On the dashboard that I have created, you can find some information about Coffe Sales, such as total sales over time, sales by country and top 5 customers. Here you can also filter order date, roast type name, size and loyalty card. Thank you, and I hope it proves beneficial to you.**
